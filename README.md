# FPL_24-25

This is my personal, on-going project where I will be applying data analysis and data science techniques to play Fantasy Premier League (FPL). This is my second year playing FPL, and my goal this year is to place within the top 100K players overall out of roughly 10 million players (Top 1% Global).
